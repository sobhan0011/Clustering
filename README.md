# A Brief Explanation
Here we are given a dataset consisting of different domains. For each image, a feature vector and it's label is given. The label demonstrates the content of the image itself, we have no information about the domains label nor the number of domains.
# Step 1: Clustering
Firstly, we selected the best clustering algorithm and checked whether the algorithm we chose and the parameters we set are suitable for clustering our data or not. We used visualization method to evaluate our clustering.
# Step 2: Finding the number of domains
We found number of clusters due to our chosen algorithm. At the end we had to show the number of domains and what domain each cluster points at.
# Step 3: Evaluation with cluster labels
When it comes to test, there are 2 files. The first, identified the clustersâ€™ labels for a small part of the training data (5 percent) and the second is the test data. Using these, we eventually evaluated our algorithm and the method we utilized.
